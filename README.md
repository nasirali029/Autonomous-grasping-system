# Autonomous-grasping-system
The project aim to perform computer vision-guided autonomous grasping system, where the rover detects nearby AR-tags (fiducial markers) based objects, determines the most suitable grasping approaches using its robotic arm, plan and execute Motion Planning (MoveIt) to pick-up and place small objects
